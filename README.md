# RaOS â€” an OS that makes no sense

Just an evening hack, Thursday June 29, 2012.

Requirements:

- NASM assembler
- [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/) emulator

The vN directories contain stages of the early development, which is based on <http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html> and <http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html>.
